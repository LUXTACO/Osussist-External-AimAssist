  Before you read anything else, If you are looking for the <strong>FULL IN DEPTH</strong> explanation on how it works check out my <a href="https://youtube.com/@takkeshi_dev">channel</a> in which Ill try to upload the in depth explanation of most of my scripts!
  <br><br>
  Osussist is a tool that provides real-time aim assistance for the rhythm game osu. It is fully undetectable by the osu anti-cheat and open source, so you can see how it works and even make it better if you want.
